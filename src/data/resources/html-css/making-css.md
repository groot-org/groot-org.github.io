I need good CSS to make my projects look good.  But I'm a back-end guy and feel like I need to re-teach myself certain features of CSS3 to achieve many of the visual effects I want.  Making CSS makes this easier as it asks you to input parameters of your effects and it generates CSS3 for you including browser-specific code.  Use it for a project and you'll never not use it again.
