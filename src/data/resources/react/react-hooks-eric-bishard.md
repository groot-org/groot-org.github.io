React was released in 2013 making heavy use of JavaScript classes.  In 2018, a major update introduced Hooks, a faster, simpler, more powerful, and more versatile architecture.  Facebook has indicated however that it has no plans to discontinue class-component support so unfortunately many React resources still use them.  Your first stop in learning React should be The Net Ninja's React Tutorial series and the second should be this exhaustive article by <a href='https://twitter.com/httpJunkie' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Eric Bishard</a>.
