Whenever I need to learn a new technology, step one is to see if there's a video tutorial by <a href='https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the "Net Ninja" Shaun Pelling</a>.  His lessons are excellent, easy-to-follow, and will give you all the skills you need to build your first project.  If you need to learn to use React this should be your first stop.
