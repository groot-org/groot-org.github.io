Gatsby is a framework that supercharges React.  It confers the advantages of using a static site generator (SSG) while automating processes like URL routing and content wrapping.  It also has a wealth of plugins available, a vibrant support community, and a library of starter sites to quickly stub up a project around.  Gatsby was also used to build this website.  Learn Gatsby.  You'll love it.
