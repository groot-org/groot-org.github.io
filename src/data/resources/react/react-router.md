Just as react is an essential tool for any front-end JavaScript developer, React Router is an invaluable tool for the React developer.  React Router simplifies and strengthens the ability of React to perform URL routing in the front-end, an especially important feature when back-end routing is being used to manage database interactions.  React Router should be a part of any React project you make and is built-in to many front-end React frameworks.
