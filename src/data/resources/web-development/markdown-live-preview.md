Every project involves spinning up a development server to preview your work before committing or deploying it, but markdown for README files and such usually aren't targeted.  Markdown Live Preview is a tool that allows you copy & paste markdown data to see how it compiles.  You never have to wonder how your README.md file will look on GitHub if you view it with Markdown Live Preview first.
