No matter what technology you need to use for your web development product, MDN usually has the definitive documentation for how to use it correctly.  Though not an educational tool per se, MDN is an excellent resource when you need to see the proper syntax to use a type of function, notation, or method.  Many MDN docs are directly referenced in other sections of my resource links.
