Netlify is my go-to source for simple webhosting.  It's easy to use and configure for a simple website which will not experience enough traffic to justify paid hosting with AWS.  Its only drawback is that it does not support apps with an active back-end, so any projects you build using Node.js or Django need to be hosted elsewhere.
