There are plenty of times that I need to do some basic image processing (such as cropping or resizing an image) but don't need the features of a program like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.  Lunapic is a free web-based image processing app which is quite well-featured.  Nearly all manual image processing I do for my projects is done with Lunapic.
