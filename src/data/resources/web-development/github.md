GitHub is the best-known and most widely used source to host remote repositories for your code.  While GitHub does support app deployment via GitHub Pages, significant downtime for free customers makes this an undesirable resource.  Add a second remote origin to your project for Heroku or link Netlify to your repo for deployment, depending on your tech stack.
