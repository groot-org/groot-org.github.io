W3Schools is a resource very similar to MDN Web Docs.  On the plus side, it's usually written in a way that's more accessible to the neophyte programmer.  On the minus side, it's not well-curated and has a fair amount of information reflecting old and deprecated practice.  It's a good reference tool but one that should be used cautiously.
