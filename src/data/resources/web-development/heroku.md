Heroku is a cloud-hosting platforms with free and paid tiers where you can host web apps.  It should be noted that it has frequent downtime for free users which among other reasons makes Netlify generally superior alternative.  However, it has support for apps with a Node.js or Django back-end which Netlify does not.  For apps that require such and don't warrant paid hosting with AWS, Heroku is the best choice.
