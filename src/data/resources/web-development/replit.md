Repl.it is a browser-based IDE which is very similar to Codepen.  Though it lacks the social aspects of Codepen, I feel it has a UI which is easier to navigate.  I frequently use it to test color schemes, click handlers, and other small snippets of code in an isolated environment outside of my projects.
